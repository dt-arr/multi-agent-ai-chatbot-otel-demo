# Multi-Agent AI Chatbot with OTEL Demo

This sample application demonstrates a multi-agent AI chatbot for financial analysis, conducting news search, fundamental review, and technical analysis. The application is built on a Single Supervisor with multiple agents architecture as described [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/docs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor.ipynb). 

The multiple agents use OpenAI LLM models and TavilySearch tool for news search, plus Yahoo Finance for fundamental and technical analysis.

Inspired by: [FinancialAIAgent-Langchain](https://github.com/Dynatrace-Asad-Ali/FinancialAIAgent-Langchain).

## Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **News Agent**: Searches and analyzes financial news

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Source environment variables (if using .env.local)
source .env.local

# Start the application
streamlit run main.py
```

### Subsequent Runs
After initial setup:
```bash
# Quick restart using the setup script
./setup_env.sh
# Press Enter for all existing values, then 'y' to start

# Or manually
source financial-agent/bin/activate
source .env.local  # Load environment variables
streamlit run main.py
```

## Usage
The application uses Streamlit to create a web interface accessible through your browser. Once launched, it displays the URL to access the chatbot UI.

The supervisor agent coordinates between multiple specialized agents, providing users with financial and insurance assistance through a conversational interface.

## Instrumentation and Monitoring

### Traceloop Integration
The application uses Traceloop to send telemetry data to Dynatrace. The instrumentation provides:

**Standard Telemetry:**
- Request/response tracking
- Agent interaction flows
- Tool usage analytics
- Performance metrics

**Insurance Agent Specific:**
- Safety violation detection and categorization
- Query risk level assessment
- Response quality scoring
- Compliance monitoring
- Fraud attempt tracking

### Dynatrace Configuration
To capture telemetry data in Dynatrace, provide:
* `DYNATRACE_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (format: `https://<tenant>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp`)
* `DYNATRACE_API_TOKEN` (with OpenTelemetry ingest permissions)

### Debug Tracing
Enable console tracing for detailed debugging:
```bash
export OTEL_CONSOLE_TRACES=true
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This makes console output extremely verbose and should only be used for debugging.

## Customization

### Branding
The application supports customizable branding through environment variables:
* `COMPANY_NAME` - Sets the company name displayed in the app title and page configuration
* `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` - Service name for telemetry identification

### Policy Data
Modify `insurance_policy.txt` to customize the insurance agent with your own policy information for demo purposes.

## Example Configuration

Example `.env.local` file (auto-generated by setup script):
```bash
# LLM AUTH
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-actual-openai-key'
TAVILY_API_KEY='tvly-your-actual-tavily-key'

# Dynatrace Configuration  
DYNATRACE_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT='https://abc12345.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp'
DYNATRACE_API_TOKEN='dt007.your-actual-dynatrace-token'

# OTEL and TRACELOOP ENV VARIABLES
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE="delta"
TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=true
OTEL_CONSOLE_TRACES=false

# Client Configuration
COMPANY_NAME="Acme Insurance Corp"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="AcmeAIAgent"
```

## Security Notes
- The setup script automatically adds `.env.local` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commit of sensitive data
- API keys are masked in the console display (showing only first and last 4 characters)
- All sensitive environment variables are handled securely during setup
- Never commit `.env.local` or any files containing API keys to version control
